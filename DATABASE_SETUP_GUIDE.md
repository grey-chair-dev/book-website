# üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Guide

1. Copy the **entire contents** of `setup-database.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL editor
3. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### 3. Verify Setup
1. Go to **"Table Editor"** in the left sidebar
2. You should see 3 tables:
   - `books` (3 records)
   - `blog_posts` (3 records) 
   - `author` (1 record)

### 4. Test Your Admin System

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "snippet doesn't exist" error:
- Don't use snippets, create a new query instead
- Copy the entire SQL from `setup-database.sql`
- Paste directly into the SQL editor

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're logged into your Supabase account
- Check that you have admin access to the project

### If tables don't appear:
- Check the SQL editor for error messages
- Make sure all SQL ran successfully
- Try running the SQL in smaller chunks
