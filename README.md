A modern, responsive website for bestselling author Suzanne Collins, built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## About This Project

This is a **demonstration project** showcasing the capabilities of our website rebuilding service. We rebuilt Suzanne Collins' original website to demonstrate how we can transform outdated websites into modern, high-performing digital experiences.

### Original Website Analysis

The original Suzanne Collins website suffered from several common issues that plague outdated websites:

- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Non-responsive design that didn't work well on modern devices
- **Outdated Design**: Visual design that looked dated and didn't reflect current web standards
- **Slow Performance**: Bloated code and inefficient loading patterns
- **Poor Accessibility**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation issues, and WCAG compliance gaps
- **Limited Functionality**: Static content without modern interactive features
- **SEO Issues**: Poor semantic structure and missing optimization opportunities
